Let's say we have mutable classes Engine and Wheel:
Engine
String type;
int horsePower;
int volume;
Wheel
int radius;
int width;
Create immutable class Car
Car
String manufacturer;
String model;
Engine engine;
List<Wheel> wheels;
Ensure that class Car really immutable, even with mutable classes Engine and Wheel.
