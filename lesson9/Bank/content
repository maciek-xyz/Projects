We are going to implement simple banking application.
We need to have the next:
- Account with possibility:
* top up
* withdraw
* setting percents
* apply percents on balance
* getting current balance
* getting account number
- Debit account:
* does not allow <0 balance
* apply percents on balance -> should increase balance on percents difference
- Credit account:
* has credit limit
* apply percents on balance -> in case of negative balance should decrease it on percents difference
- Bank with next properties:
* name
* accounts
* Bank can topUp own accounts
* Bank can withDraw own accounts
- National Bank which:
* contains all registered banks
